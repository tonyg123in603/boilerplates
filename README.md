# Boilerplates for Automation and Deployment

These are forked templates and configurations from [xcad2k/boilerplates](https://github.com/xcad2k/boilerplates).  I also use in various projects and deployment scenarios. They are based on automation and deployment tools such as Ansible, Docker, Terraform, and much more.

#xcad2k# created them as free resources to be extended by you according to your specific use cases. THis person has placed a considerable amount of work for the benefit of everyone. I highly encourage all users to explore his work and support him if you are able. This is his YouTube Channel: [The Digital Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZNhwA1B5YqiY1nLzmM0ZRg). This IT pro makes videos in English as well as German.
